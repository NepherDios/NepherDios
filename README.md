# 👋 Hey there, I'm Rui Moreira

### 🧠 Main Programming Focus
- C  
- Python  
- Bash  
- Java  
- JavaScript  
- COBOL  
- Assembly  

I love low-level control and system programming — building things that run fast, efficiently, and close to the hardware ⚙️

### 🧩 What I’m Into
- 🧱 Systems programming & OS internals  
- 🧮 Automation and integration testing on Linux  
- 🧰 Building modular C frameworks  
- 🤖 Virtual robotics & AI simulations  
- 💡 Learning how everything works under the hood  

---

### 🧪 Current Focus

- Studying Python testing frameworks (pytest, unittest)  
- Exploring assembly and computer architecture  

---

### 🔧 Tools & Environments
- Linux (main environment 🐧)  
- GCC, GDB, Make, Valgrind  
- Git & GitHub Actions  
- VS Code / Vim  
- Python, Bash scripting
