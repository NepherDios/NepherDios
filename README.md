# üëã Hey there, I'm Rui

### üß† Main Programming Focus
- C/C++  
- Python  
- Bash  
- Java  
- JavaScript  
- COBOL  
- Assembly  

I love low-level control and system programming ‚Äî building things that run fast, efficiently, and close to the hardware ‚öôÔ∏è

### üß© What I‚Äôm Into
- üß± Systems programming & OS internals
- üßÆ Automation and integration testing on Linux
- üß∞ Building modular C frameworks
- ü§ñ Virtual robotics & AI simulations
- üí° Learning how everything works under the hood

---

### üß™ Current Focus
- Deep diving into C (pointers, memory, modular design)
- Studying Python testing frameworks (pytest, unittest)
- Exploring assembly and computer architecture

---

### üîß Tools & Environments
- Linux
- GCC, GDB, Make, Valgrind  
- Git & GitHub Actions  
- VS Code / Vim  
- Python, Bash scripting  

---

### üöÄ Goals
> ‚ÄúBe able to build anything ‚Äî from low-level systems to intelligent automation.‚Äù

- Develop my own modular car simulator in C  
- Build custom test and automation frameworks  
- Master C and Assembly for full system control

-If you can't build anything without AI, you were never meant to be a programmer! -_-

-That's what i wish to achieve, i want to be able to build anything i want, not to depend on AI which i don't trust `--_0-0_--`
