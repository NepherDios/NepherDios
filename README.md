### 🧩 What I’m Into
- 🧱 Systems programming & OS internals
- 🧮 Automation and integration testing on Linux
- 🔒 Systems Pentesting and Hardening
- 🧰 Building modular C frameworks
- 🤖 Virtual robotics & AI simulations
- 💡 Learning how everything works under the hood

---

### 🧪 Current Focus
- Deep diving into C (pointers, memory, modular design)
- Studying Python testing frameworks (pytest, unittest)
- Exploring assembly and computer architecture

---

### 🔧 Tools & Environments
- Windows / Linux
- GCC, GDB, Make, Valgrind  
- Git & GitHub Actions  
- VS Code / Vim  
- Python, Bash scripting
